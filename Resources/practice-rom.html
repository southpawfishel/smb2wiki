<h2>How to Install</h2>
<p>You will need a legally obtained ROM of the game, and you can use an IPS patching tool like <a href="https://www.marcrobledo.com/RomPatcher.js/">this one</a> to apply the patch to your ROM. You are on your own in obtaining the base ROM to use.</p>
<h2>Supported Platforms</h2>
<p>The practice ROM is known to work on NES and Famicom hardware when using an <a href="https://everdrive.me/cartridges/edn8nes.html">Everdrive</a>, and on an NES emulator on PC/Mac.</p>
<p>TODO: Full list of supported emulators</p>
<h2>How to Use</h2>
<p>Once you have launched the ROM using your platform of choice, start a new game, choose your character, and start the first level. Once you are in 1-1, you can press Select to bring up the practice menu, which will allow you to adjust your health, amount of lives and continues, jump to any level, and choose which screen of that level to warp to when you start it.</p>
