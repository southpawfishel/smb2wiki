<p>The Ladder Clip is a trick that can be performed using any character that exploits the game's collision behavior when the character is invincible and also climbing up a ladder. This trick allows the character to clip down through the floor and warp to the next screen as though they had entered the screen via a ladder from the top.</p>
<h1>NES</h1>
<p>There are two ways to perform this trick.</p>
<h2>Intentionally Getting Hit First</h2>
<p>If the character has just taken damage, they will have a certain number of invincibility frames during which the game's collision behavior works a bit differently than normal. If the character is climbing up on a ladder while in an invincibility frame (also known as an iframe) and an enemy or item falls on the character, they will be pushed down through the floor.</p>
<p>The easiest way to perform this trick involves intentionally taking damage, followed by making an enemy or item fall on top of the character while climbing a ladder. How exactly to make an enemy fall on top of the character is situation dependent, but the most well known example is in <a href="/list-of-levels/world-1/1-1">level 1-1</a> to enter the Birdo fight without having to bomb the wall inside the cave.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Enter the <a href="/list-of-levels/world-1/1-1">1-1</a> cave, go left, and jump up to the platform with the Shyguy.</li>
  <li>Allow the character to be hit by the shyguy, then immediately jump on and pick up the Shyguy.</li>
  <li>Jump towards the ladder and go all the way to the left against the wall.</li>
  <li>Once the character has fallen at a level below the top of the ladder, turn back to the right and throw the Shyguy, if done right, the Shyguy will bounce in such a way that it lingers in the air long enough to allow the character to fall to the bottom of the ladder.</li>
  <li>Press up to start climbing the ladder when the Shyguy has almost reached the character.</li>
  <li>If done correctly, the character will warp through the floor and appear at the top of the next screen as though they had just climbed down a ladder. The player can perform a <a href="/mechanics-and-glitches/vine-jump">Vine Jump</a> from here to quickly reach Birdo.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Without Getting Hit First</h2>
<p>This is a variation of this trick that requires a bit more precise timing to pull off, but can be faster with some characters, particularly Luigi due to his slow falling speed making it difficult to perform the normal version of the trick before running out of iframes.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Enter the <a href="/list-of-levels/world-1/1-1">1-1</a> cave, go left and jump up to the platform with the Shyguy.</li>
  <li>Pick up the Shyguy.</li>
  <li>Jump towards the ladder and go all the way to the left against the wall.</li>
  <li>Once the character has fallen at a level below the top of the ladder, turn back to the right and throw the Shyguy, if done right, the Shyguy will bounce in such a way that it lingers in the air long enough to allow the character to fall to the bottom of the ladder.</li>
  <li>Press up to start climbing right before the falling Shyguy collides with the character, then immediately press and hold down.</li>
  <li>If done correctly, the character will clip partially through the floor, and repeatedly pressing down will cause the character to move the rest of the way through the floor to perform the warp to the Birdo screen.</li>
</ol>

<p>TODO: Make a video explaining how to do this version with an input display, since the specific input timing makes this much more difficult than the other version.</p>
