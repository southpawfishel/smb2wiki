<p>The Veggie Glitch is a very precise trick that allows the player to carry an item through a door for use on another screen. The steps to perform the glitch are as follows:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Pick up a potion.</li>
  <li>Throw the potion such that the subspace door is on top of a veggie.</li>
  <li>Enter subspace, then immediately exit subspace.</li>
  <li>On the first frame after exiting subspace, press B to pick up the veggie. If timed correctly, the veggie will be "stuck" inside the character's head rather than carried above the character's head. After walking through a door, the character will be carrying the veggie normally.</li>
</ol>
<p>The best-known application of this glitch is to carry a veggie into the Birdo screen on <a href="/list-of-levels/world-1/1-2">1-2</a> to kill Birdo more quickly. This glitch can also be used to pick up a POW block, which is used to perform the most advanced version of the <a href="/mechanics-and-glitches/ladder-clip">Ladder Clip</a> in <a href="/list-of-levels/world-1/1-1">1-1</a>.</p>
