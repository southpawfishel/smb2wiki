<p>The Potion Jump is a trick that is used in <a href="/list-of-levels/world-6/6-3">level 6-3</a> as a way to jump over the wall with the quicksand underneath it immediately to the left on the second screen. The trick can be done using Luigi or Princess Toadstool, though Luigi is the faster character to use in speed runs since he doesn't have to charge up a super jump first.</p>
<p>This trick exploits the fact that items that have been thrown can be jumped off as though they were a platform as long as they are in midair. To perform the trick, after coming up the ladder at the start of the level, and then grab the potion. Then jump to the top of the taller of the two cacti to the right and run towards the left and jump off the top of the cactus. Approximately when Luigi reaches the right edge of the big cloud in the sky, throw the potion at the wall, and if timed correctly, Luigi's feet will come in contact with the potion fairly close to the wall, at which point there's a window of a few frames in which to perform a jump.</p>
