<p>Each character in the game has different movement characteristics. Please refer to the following table for each character's specific values. In general, the most important distinction for speedrunning is that all characters run at the same speed when carrying nothing, but Toad runs 1.2x faster than other characters while carrying an enemy or item, so Toad is the best choice for most levels in the game.</p>

<h2>Super Jump</h2>
<p>Also known as a power squat jump or squat jump. This is a move that can be performed by any character allowing them to jump higher than their normal jump height. The player must hold down to crouch until their character starts flashing, then press A to super jump. &nbsp;The character doesn't have to remain crouched to do this, as it is possible to stand up and retain the charged up jump for a few seconds. However, moving left or right will cancel the charged up jump. This is used in quite a few levels for Toad to be able to reach platforms he can't reach with a normal jump.</p>
<p>It's sometimes advantageous to be able to super jump up to a high platform while carrying an item. On the NES, this is a bit difficult to do while maintaining good movement speed. Normally, a player wants to be holding B all the time while running, but if the player performs a Super Jump while holding B, the character will throw whatever item they are holding as soon as they jump. In order to carry an item while Super Jumping, the player must stop holding B before jumping. Once the character has landed, pressing and holding B to start running again will cause the character to throw the item, which will cause a loss of speed and require picking the item up again. To get around this limitation, quickly pause the game, hold B, and unpause the game. This allows the player to start holding B again to run without the character throwing the item.</p>

<h2>Movement on Ice</h2>
<p>Since the character accelerates slower on ice than on normal surfaces, the fastest way to reach full speed is to jump immediately while moving to the right to take advantage of the quicker acceleration through the air than on the ice.</p>
<p>The main application of this is to save time at the beginning of <a href="/list-of-levels/world-4/4-1">4-1</a>.</p>
<h2>Character Specific Movement Behaviors</h2>
<p>Specifically the following characters have notable movement behavior that's useful for speed running.</p>
<h3>Toad</h3>
<p>Toad runs faster than other characters in the game while he's holding an enemy and also while holding certain types of items. For this reason, he is the most frequently used character.</p>
<h3>Luigi</h3>
<p>Luigi jumps higher and falls more slowly than other characters. To get the maximum distance from a jump while moving, hold A during the entire jump, as holding the jump button makes Luigi fall much more slowly. He also gets extra frames to <a href="/mechanics-and-glitches/vine-jump">vine jump</a>, making that trick a bit easier with Luigi than with other characters.</p>
<h3>Princess Toadstool</h3>
<p>The Princess has a unique floating ability stops her from falling and allows her to hover at a fixed vertical position in the air for a limited duration. To activate this, hold jump while in midair.</p>
