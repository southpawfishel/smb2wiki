<p>Vine jumps (also known as chain jumps or ladder jumps) are a trick that allows the character to jump immediately after leaving a vine or chain or ladder, which enables the character to move more vertically more quickly than climbing normally. While climbing a vine, holding either Up + Left or Up&nbsp;+ Right &nbsp;will allow the character to jump off the vine near the edge. Luigi has 8 frames to perform the jump. The other characters have 3 frames to perform it.</p>
