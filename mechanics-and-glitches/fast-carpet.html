<p>The Fast Carpet Glitch is a trick that enables moving on a carpet much faster than the normal carpet speed. To perform the trick:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Jump on a Pidget, &nbsp;and throw it away.</li>
  <li>Ride the carpet back to the left away from the Pidget spawn point, then move back to the right to respawn the Pidget.</li>
  <li>Pick up the second Pidget, then jump back on the original carpet.</li>
  <li>The original carpet now moves at faster than normal speed.</li>
</ol>
<p>One note to be aware of is that a carpet retains its speed and direction when you jump off it, so for best results setting up this trick, keep the carpet moving directly to the right with no vertical movement before jumping off to grab the second Pidget. This will cause the first carpet to keep moving to the right at a fixed height, making it easier to jump back on the first carpet.</p>
